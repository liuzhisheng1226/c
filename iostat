iostat
   iostat - Report Central Processing Unit (CPU) statistics and input/output statistics for devices and partitions.
DESCRIPTION
       The iostat command is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time  the  devices  are
       active  in  relation to their average transfer rates. The iostat command generates reports that can be used to change
       system configuration to better balance the input/output load between physical disks.
REPORTS
       The iostat command generates two types of reports, the CPU Utilization report and the Device Utilization report.
       CPU Utilization Report
       The first report generated by the iostat command is the CPU Utilization Report.  For  multiprocessor  systems,
       the CPU values are global averages among all processors.
       Device Utilization Report
       The second report generated by the iostat command is the Device Utilization Report. The device report provides
       statistics on a per physical device or partition basis. Block devices and partitions for which statistics  are
       to  be  displayed  may be entered on the command line.  If no device nor partition is entered, then statistics
       are displayed for every device used by the system, and providing that the kernel maintains statistics for  it.
       If the ALL keyword is given on the command line, then statistics are displayed for every device defined by the
       system, including those that have never been used.  Transfer rates are shown in 1K blocks by  default,  unless
       the  environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.
